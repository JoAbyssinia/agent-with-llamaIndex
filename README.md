# agent-with-llamaIndex

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a simple agent using LlamaIndex framework. It showcases:

- Setting up a local LLM model using Ollama
- Creating custom functions for multiplication and weather data retrieval
- Implementing an agent workflow with function tools
- Demonstrating both stateless and stateful agent interactions
- Using context objects to maintain conversation history

The agent is able to perform mathematical operations and fetch weather information through defined function tools.
